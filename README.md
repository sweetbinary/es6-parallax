# es6-parallax
A simple ES6 parallax script which adds parallax effects to elements on the page just by adding a class to them.

Can be set to execute only at a minimum width (line 79 on .js and line 19 on .css).

Add class .plax-effect to element you wish to add parallax effect. Additional classes can be added and daisy chained, such as .transition-delay-250
